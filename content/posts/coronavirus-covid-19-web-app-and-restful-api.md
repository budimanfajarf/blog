## Web Application

A few days ago I've created a single web application about coronavirus COVID-19 info, it's created with **Vue.js** and apply skeleton loading. The data are fetched from Rest API I created before :)

* Web App: [covid19.budidev.com](https://covid19.budidev.com "Web App COVID-19 Info")
* Repo: [github.com/budimanfajarf/covid19](https://github.com/budimanfajarf/covid19 "Repository Web App COVID-19")

## Restful API

Before I build the web app, I build this Rest API first with **Node.js**. It's consume data from another API, I calculate source data then add new data like percent, total data, etc, the goal is to create a simple API :)
