4 days ago I decided to join a challenge called #100DaysOfCode. The challenge is quite interesting for me so I decided to join in, the main rules of this challenge are **Code minimum an hour every day and tweet the progress on Twitter with #100DaysOfCode hashtag for the next 100 days.**

You can see detail information of the challenge on the [official website](https://100daysofcode.com "Official Website #100DaysOfCode Challenge")

See my progress on [my git log](https://github.com/budimanfajarf/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md "Git Log #100DaysOfCode") or [my twitter](https://twitter.com/budimanfajarf "Twitter budimanfajarf") :)
