A few days ago I got errors when deploy my blog (Hugo site) to Netlify.

# Errors

Here's the pieces of errors:

    ...
    ...
    8:41:49 AM: ERROR 2020/05/03 01:41:49 render of "taxonomyTerm" failed: "/opt/build/repo/layouts/tags/terms.html:15:25": execute of template failed: template: tags/terms.html:15:25: executing "main" at <.Page.Permalink>: can't evaluate field Page in type hugolib.OrderedTaxonomyEntry
    8:41:49 AM: Total in 179 ms
    8:41:49 AM: Error: Error building site: failed to render pages: render of "taxonomyTerm" failed: "/opt/build/repo/layouts/_default/terms.html:15:20": execute of template failed: template: _default/terms.html:15:20: executing "main" at <.Page.Permalink>: can't evaluate field Page in type hugolib.OrderedTaxonomyEntry
    ...
    ...
    8:41:49 AM: Error running command: Build script returned non-zero exit code: 255
    8:41:49 AM: Failing build: Failed to build site
    8:41:49 AM: failed during stage 'building site': Build script returned non-zero exit code: 255
    8:41:49 AM: Finished processing build request in 14.990296865s

So, as usual, I open a new tab in the browser to find solutions on the internet, and then after a while, I found an article from the official Hugo website, here's the link: [Hugo taxonomy templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/taxonomy-templates/ "Hugo taxonomy templates").

# Reason Errors

After reading the article, I found the reason why I got errors when I deploy my site to Netlify, code below the reason why I getting the errors:

{{< highlight go-html-template >}}
<ul>
    {{ range .Data.Terms.Alphabetical }}
        <li><a href="{{ .Page.Permalink }}">{{ .Page.Title }}</a> {{ .Count }}</li>
    {{ end }}
</ul>
{{< /highlight >}}

Order Taxonomies with the approach above is **only available in Hugo 0.55 and later.**

Before the version 0.55 you would have to do something like:

{{< highlight go-html-template >}}
<ul>
    {{ $type := .Type }}
    {{ range $key, $value := .Data.Terms.Alphabetical }}
        {{ $name := .Name }}
        {{ $count := .Count }}
        {{ with $.Site.GetPage (printf "/%s/%s" $type $name) }}
            <li><a href="{{ .Permalink }}">{{ $name }}</a> {{ $count }}</li>
        {{ end }}
    {{ end }}
</ul>
{{< /highlight >}}    

So, my conclusion is that the **Hugo version on Netlify less than 0.55, while my local version is 0.69.2**, and the first code approach above only available in Hugo 0.55 and later. That's why I got the errors.

# Solutions

Then what's the solutions?  If you have the same errors or similar like I got, you can try 2 options.

First you can change the code like second code approach above, so that can runs on Hugo version you running on Netlify.

Or you can do like what I do

Instead change the code, I prefer to add a new file to my site, the file is `netlify.toml`. This file can **set Hugo version** and other settings for your environments in Netlify.

When I deploy my Hugo site to Netlify on the first time I don't create `netlify.toml`, but everything works fine until I customize the layouts theme site to add a list of terms taxonomies tags and then got the errors.

Because that errors, I decided to add `netlify.toml` to **ensure Hugo version** in Netlify has the same version with my local machine, so that can **reduce similar errors in the future** because different Hugo version.

Here's code in my `netlify.toml` file:
{{< highlight toml >}}
[build]
publish = "public"
command = "hugo --gc --minify"

[context.production.environment]
HUGO_VERSION = "0.69.2"
HUGO_ENV = "production"
HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = "true"

[context.split1]
command = "hugo --gc --minify --enableGitInfo"

[context.split1.environment]
HUGO_VERSION = "0.69.2"
HUGO_ENV = "production"

[context.deploy-preview]
command = "hugo --gc --minify --buildFuture -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL"

[context.deploy-preview.environment]
HUGO_VERSION = "0.69.2"

[context.branch-deploy]
command = "hugo --gc --minify -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL"

[context.branch-deploy.environment]
HUGO_VERSION = "0.69.2"

[context.next.environment]
HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = "true"
{{< /highlight >}} 

Save `netlify.toml` file into your `root directory` Hugo site, and then push + re-deploy into Netlify, if everything works fine the errors should be gone and you can preview your site before publishing.

You can see the newest example `netlify.toml`on official Hugo website: [Configure Hugo version in Netlify](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/#configure-hugo-version-in-netlify "Configure Hugo version in Netlify").
