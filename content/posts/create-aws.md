Earlier before I've posted an article about [How to Install LEMP Stack On Ubuntu AWS EC2](/2020/06/install-lemp-stack-linux-nginx-mysql-php-ubuntu-18-04-aws-ec2/ "How to Install LEMP Stack On Ubuntu AWS EC2"). To launch an AWS EC2 Instance, first you have to own an AWS account, so in this post, I will show you how to create an AWS account then you will have access to [Free Tier Offers by AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/ "Free Tier Offers by AWS").

First, go to [AWS Sign Up Portal](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup "AWS Sign Up Portal"), fill the required fields, then click <code>**Continue**</code>

After that you will be asked for contact information, fill the required fields, then click <code>**Create Account and Continue**</code>

The next step is payment information, you can use Debit or Credit Card which accepted by AWS like Visa, Master Card, etc.

Noted here you will be **<u>charged $1 USD/EUR</u>** by AWS as verification to ensure the card is valid.

Fill the payment information, then click <code>**Verify and Add**</code>

Next, before you can use your AWS account, you must add a phone number and verify it using verification code that will send via SMS.

Fill the phone number and the security check, then click <code>**Send SMS**</code>

You may have to wait a few minutes until you can sign in to [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ "AWS Management Console").
