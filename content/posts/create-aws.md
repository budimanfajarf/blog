Earlier before I've posted an article about [How to Install LEMP Stack On Ubuntu AWS EC2](2020/06/install-lemp-stack-linux-nginx-mysql-php-ubuntu-18-04-aws-ec2/ "How to Install LEMP Stack On Ubuntu AWS EC2"). To create an AWS EC2 Instance first you have to owned an AWS Account, so in this post I will show you how to create an AWS Account then you will have access to [Free Tier Offers by AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/ "Free Tier Offers by AWS").

First go to [AWS Sign Up Portal](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup "AWS Sign Up Portal"), fill the required fields, then click <code><strong>Continue</strong></code>

The next step is payment information, you can use Debit or Credit Card which accepted by AWS like Visa, Master Card, etc.

Noted here you will **<u>charged $1 USD/EUR</u>** by AWS as verification to ensure the card is valid.
